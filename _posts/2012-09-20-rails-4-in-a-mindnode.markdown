I'm preparing a presentation for RubyConf Argentina where I'm going to
talk about Rails 4 new features and changes. I use to think first in a
high level and MindNode is a great tool for that. The first thing I did
was checking what were we adding, removing, deprecating in Rails 4 (I
don't have very good memory :P), and then come up with this MindNode I'm
sharing with you â€¦

[![Rails 4 MindNode](/images/posts/Rails4-mini.png "Rails 4
MindNode")](/images/posts/Rails4.png)

I could be missing some stuff or could even be things that won't make to
Rails 4. But that's the picture as of today. If you find something that I'm
missing or that I should change please let me know. I will keep this
MindNode updated so keep checking it.
