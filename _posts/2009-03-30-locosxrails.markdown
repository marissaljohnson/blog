We're attending [Locos X Rails (Locos X Rails)](http://www.locosxrails.com) conference !!!! 

It will be held on April 3rd and 4th at Universidad de Palermo in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Who are the speakers going to be? Obie Fernandez, Yehuda Katz, David Heinemeier Hansson (via teleconference), Luis Lavena, Fabio Akita, and many more!
Does anyone sounds familiar?

It is with no doubt a great opportunity that we just couldn't miss...

Hope to see you all there!
