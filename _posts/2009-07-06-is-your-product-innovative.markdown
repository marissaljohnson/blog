That's a good question, in fact, can we quantify or measure how much "innovation" quantity exists in our product or services?. Well, there are as much answers as successful products ;-) but in general terms we can group Innovation in three categories:

    * Business Model

          Is your Business Model Innovative? did you find out a new way to sell? did you find out an hidden need of the community? Starbucks would be a nice example.
    * Tech
            
          Did you invent new super algorithm to ultra-fast classify all the info on the web ;-) - that a techy innovation -. Tech is a great point for innovation, but not the only one, think about twitter for example.
    * Design

           Design in fact is key a factor for innovation, for example think about the IPhone or the IPod, the key was the design and the marketing.

     So you reader, Rails Enthusiast, Ruby Rockstar, Code Ninja, are you ready to innovate in the wide sense or the word?
