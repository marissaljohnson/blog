Nowadays companies face the challenge of obtaining tangible results in the short term. Market’s dynamism also require a fast adaptability to changes that arise during the lifecycle of the software product development.

For this reason, WyeWorks favors processes based on Agile methodologies. We believe that following an agile process with short, incremental development cycles (sprints) will allow us to deliver the best possible product in the short term.

We aim to provide at the end of each cycle, a potentially shippable product with the best possible quality.

We wrote this post as a guideline of the recommended process, however for a better understanding, we suggest holding an interactive meeting for a deeper explanation of the process.

# Actors

## Product Owner (PO)
The product owner is the person who represents the stakeholders, generally someone on the client side. It’s important to state that it’s only one person, and should be the same throughout the entire development.

Has the vision of the product and understanding of the user needs. Is responsible for the definition of the PRODUCT BACKLOG, a series of stories that describe the product’s desired functionalities.


### Backlog Refining
Among the PO’s responsibilities, is that of the backlog refining activities. This implies reviewing the stories in the product backlog, doing any needed adjustment: addition of new stories, redefinition of existing ones, removal of unwanted functionalities, and prioritization.

## Development Team (Team)
The Team provided by WyeWorks is usually a mix of expert software engineers, architects, programmers, analysts, etc. They have the autonomy to choose how to best meet the goals, and is held responsible for them.

# Sprints
The sprints usually take 1 or 2 weeks (defined based on the project needs), and includes the following series of steps intended to ensure a correct execution of the iterations.

## 1. Planning meeting (60’)
Takes place at the start of the Sprint, and involves the PO and the Team. The goal is to define the Sprint Product Backlog based on the Product Backlog, including those stories the Team commits to finish by the end of the Sprint.

## 2. Daily meetings (15’)
During the development process, regular meetings are held every day to keep track of development status.

Usually in this meeting, each team member answer the following questions: * What did you do yesterday?
* What will you do today?
* Are there any impediments in your way?

The PO attendance is not mandatory, but is advised. The quick status update will provide an overall idea of the sprint progress.

## 3. Review meeting (30’)
Held at the end of the sprint, between the PO and the team, to validate and approve the finished stories. All of those that pass this evaluation are included in the sprint deliverable.

Stories that are not approved are moved back to the product backlog so they can be included in the following planning.

## 4. Backlog Refining meeting (90-120’)
The Team reviews the product backlog and tries to identify any issues that require clarification, this serves as input for the PO, and aids in the Backlog Refining.

This revision can include either the stories for the following sprint, or a bigger number of stories, allowing the PO to work on the prioritization for more than one sprint. Allowing for a lesser dedication of the PO, in the planning of following sprints, if required.

## 5. Retrospective (60’)
This meeting closes the sprint, the goal is to detect process improvement opportunities.

￼The Team reflects on how things were done, and selects three aspects to improve, composing an action plan for the following sprint. In the next retrospective the Team also analyses the execution of the agreed action plan.

The software delivery for the sprint, takes place at the end, usually after the Review meeting. The delivery times depend on the technical aspects of each project: infrastructure, deployment processes specified by the client, etc.

# Workflow

During the development process, the stories in the Product Backlog go through a series of states before reaching the accepted state. The following diagram shows each state definition and the actions that trigger the transition from one to the other.
