I'll be talking at [RubyConf Argentina](http://rubyconfargentina.org/en),
and the first thing I usually do when preparing talks is to think in a
high level and then start going down form there. I find MindNode a great
tool for that. So I started checking what was being added, removed and
deprecated in Rails 4 (my memory isn't good enough to have all that in the
top of my head :P). The result is this MindNode I'm sharing with you â€¦

I could be missing some stuff or could even be things that won't make it to
Rails 4, but that's the picture as of today. If you find something that I'm
missing or that I should change please let me know. I will keep this
MindNode updated so keep checking it.

**UPDATE #1**: [Support for specifying transaction isolation
level](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/392eeecc11a291e406db927a18b75f41b2658253)

**UPDATE #2**: [Turbolinks](https://github.com/rails/turbolinks/)
